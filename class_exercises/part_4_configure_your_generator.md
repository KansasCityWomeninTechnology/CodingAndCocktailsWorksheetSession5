### Part 4: Configure your generator {#part-4-configure-your-generator}

There are custom options available for the fountain-webapp generator. Let's make our configuration selections now.

1.  Select the **Fountain Webapp** option after running the `yo` command.

- Make sure you are in the folder you want to scaffold into before continuing. You created this in [Part 1](part_1_create_a_project_folder.md).
- You can use `pwd` to see your current directory and `cd` if you need to change directories.

1.  Make the selections in the following screenshot. ![](../assets/images/fountain-webapp-options.png)

1.  Once Yeoman is done, explore your directory structure using Atom or explorer to see what scaffolding has been created. Youâ€™ll notice that the structure is different than what we saw with the manual practice on this worksheet. This is a good example of two different application types that use two different types of directory structures.

Yeoman will be installing a bunch of files and can take a few minutes. It can even seem like nothing is going on in your CLI at times [but trust me, it is]. This is a great time to get another drink & socialize with your neighbors!

If you happen to close or cancel the CLI window during this time, no fear! Make sure _mytodo_ is the current working directory [hint: `pwd`] in your CLI, and type: `npm install` and the process will kick-off and finish installing.

Note: Cloud9 users, this process can easily take 15 minutes.
