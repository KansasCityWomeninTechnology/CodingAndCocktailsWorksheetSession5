# Objects and Scopes {#top}
Grouping like properties and functionality together can make applications easier to write and maintain. Keeping scope small and targeted is part of that process. These are abstract concepts and will require hands-on practice to connect the dots.

We will move the drink list that is hard coded in the HTML and build it out programmatically using JavaScript.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}


## Create an array of objects {#object} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We will create an array of objects and access object properties.
{% include "./1object.md" %}

## Use built in array function to build a DOM {#this} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We want to iterate over array to build the menu. We have to implement the code to build out the same HTML we commented out previously. Last time we used the built in methods to add to the DOM in a structured way. This time we'll build a string to add to the DOM. 
{% include "./2build-dom.md" %}

## Checkpoint <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Compare your _my-script.js_ against the answer key for your work so far. It might look a little different depending on spacing.  
{% include "./checkpoint.html" %}
