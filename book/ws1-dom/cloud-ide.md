You will use **CodeSandbox** tonight as your **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment. Any time the worksheet references Atom, use CodeSandbox instead.
Follow the instructions below to get your environment going.

1. Navigate to [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).

1. Click the **Create Sandbox** button at the top right of the screen.

1. In the **New Sandbox** page, click the **<span class="octicon octicon-mark-github"></span> Sign in with GitHub** button at the top right of the screen.

1. Use your GitHub credentials to sign in.

1. In the **New Sandbox** page, select **Import** tab and paste the following URL into the input box labeled **GitHub Repository URL...**: 
`https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/javascript-102/tree/ad/code-sandbox`

1. Click **Open Sandbox** to create your project.

1. Once the project loads, CodeSandbox displays 3 panes. On the far left you will see your project files. In the middle you'll see your code in the _index.html_ tab. On the right you will see your application. CodeSandbox automatically displays your application and updates after you save your file, just like Atom's atom-live-server package.

1. Before you start following the worksheet, click the **<span class="octicon octicon-repo-forked"></span> Fork** button in the toolbar. You'll see it at the top right of your screen. This makes your own copy of the project so you can save your changes.

1. You created your project and are ready to go! Follow along with the rest of the worksheet instructions using CodeSandbox in place of Atom.
