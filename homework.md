### Part 1: Another Yeoman tutorial {#part-1-another-yeoman-tutorial}

Get some more practice! Follow along with the tutorial at [http://bit.ly/2ciNXfC](http://bit.ly/2ciNXfC). You’ll be setting up a directory structure using Yeoman with another generator. The tutorial also introduces you to Grunt, a task runner, and Bower, a package manager.

### Part 2: Git {#part-2-git}

Yeoman initializes a git repository for you in your source folder. Check git by running git status. You can also stage and commit your files to your own Github repository if you’d like more practice.
