### Part 3:  Install a generator {#part-3-install-a-generator}

There are over [3500+ generators](http://yeoman.io/generators/) available for Yeoman. A generator is a plugin that can be used to scaffold your app. A plugin is software that complements and integrates into an existing application.

1.  Letâ€™s install the [Fountain Webapp](http://fountainjs.io/) generator using CLI, by typing: ``npm install -g generator-fountain-webapp``

2.  Type ``yo`` to see your generators.
