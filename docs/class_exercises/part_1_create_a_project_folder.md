### Part 1: Create a project folder {#part-1-create-a-project-folder}

When you’re starting from scratch, an empty project is simply an empty folder. You could do that visually (using your file explorer) but let’s do it in CLI.

1.  Navigate to your _CodingAndCocktails/Architecture_ folder: ``cd <your home directory>/CodingAndCocktails/Architecture``

  {% hint style='tip' %}

  - Your home directory is:
    - Mac: _/users/<yourUsername>_
    - Windows: _C:/Users/<youUsername>_
  - Command to change folders: ``cd <folderToGoTo>``
  - You can also use **~** as a shortcut in CLI for your home directory: ``cd ~``
  - Command to make a folder: ``mkdir <newFolder>``
  - Most command line applications are not case sensitive, but a few are!

  {% endhint %}

2.  Make a new folder called mytodo: ``mkdir mytodo``
3.  Move into that new folder: ``cd mytodo``

  {% hint style='tip' %}

  If you start typing the name of a folder or file, hit **tab** and it will autocomplete.

  {% endhint %}
