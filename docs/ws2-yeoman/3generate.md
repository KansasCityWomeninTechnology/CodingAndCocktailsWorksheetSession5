Yeoman installs a bunch of files and can take a few minutes. It might seem like nothing is going on in your terminal at times. This is a great time to get another drink & socialize with your neighbors!

If you close the terminal window or cancel the install process during this time, don't panic! 
You can pick back up by following these steps:
 - Navigate to your "mytodo" directory. Type `pwd` <i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i> in your terminal to double check you are in the "mytodo" directory.
 - Type `npm install` <i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i> to finish installing.

This is a good example of two different application types that use different directory structures.
