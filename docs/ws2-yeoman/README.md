# Scaffolding with Yeoman {#top}
You did a great job manually applying good front-end architecture practices! There are also tools which will help you automate this process of scaffolding your app. The term **scaffolding** refers to creating a predefined structure for your app. Let’s go over using Yeoman, one such toolset. We’ll use Yeoman to build a [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) app.
