### Another Yeoman tutorial

Get some more practice! Follow along with the tutorial on [http://bit.ly/2ciNXfC](http://bit.ly/2ciNXfC). You’ll be setting up a directory structure using Yeoman with another generator. The tutorial also introduces you to Grunt, a task runner, and Bower, a package manager.

### Git

Yeoman initializes a git repository for you in your source folder. Check git by running `git status`. You can also stage and commit your files to your own Github repository if you’d like more practice. Push your project at this point up to Github & come tell us about it in <a href="slack://channel?team=T06BZHS4U&id=C0BGBKGG6">Slack</a>!

### Extra Credit: Creating your own generators 

You can also create your own Yeoman generators for any custom projects you’re working on. Just follow along with the tutorial at [http://yeoman.io/authoring/](http://yeoman.io/authoring/).

### Extra Credit: More Yeoman

You can go further with Yeoman by configuring testing for your app, getting your app ready for production, or making your todos persistent with  [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).
