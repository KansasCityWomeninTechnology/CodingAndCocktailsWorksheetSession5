### Another Organization Technique

Read this article about [good front-end architecture](https://www.sitepoint.com/good-front-end-architecture/).

### Git

Yeoman initializes a Git repository for you in your source folder. Check Git by running `git status` <i class="fa fa-share fa-rotate-180"></i>. You can also stage and commit your files to your own Github repository if you’d like more practice. Push your project at this point up to Github & tell us about it in <a href="slack://channel?team=T06BZHS4U&id=C0BGBKGG6">Slack</a>!

### Extra Credit: Creating your own generators 

You can also create your own Yeoman generators for any custom projects you’re working on. Follow along with the tutorial at [http://yeoman.io/authoring/](http://yeoman.io/authoring/).

### Extra Credit: More Yeoman

You can go further with Yeoman by configuring testing for your app, getting your app ready for production, or making your todos persistent with  [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/).
