### Part 1: Another Yeoman tutorial {#part-1-another-yeoman-tutorial}

Get some more practice! Follow along with the tutorial at [http://bit.ly/2ciNXfC](http://bit.ly/2ciNXfC). You’ll be setting up a directory structure using Yeoman with another generator. The tutorial also introduces you to Grunt, a task runner, and Bower, a package manager.

### Part 2: Git {#part-2-git}

Yeoman initializes a git repository for you in your source folder. Check git by running `git status`. You can also stage and commit your files to your own Github repository if you’d like more practice. Push your project at this point up to Github & come tell us about it in <a href="slack://channel?team=T06BZHS4U&id=C0BGBKGG6">Slack</a>!
