# Prep Work

### 1. <a href="slack://channel?team=T06BZHS4U&id=C0BGBKGG6">Open Slack</a>

If you have a tip that helped you with a step on the worksheet, you can easily share it with the group in Slack. Or if there are any issues with the worksheet [we make typos or there's an update to a tool that we didn't catch before the session], we may post updates in Slack. Plus, after class is over, Slack becomes a tool for you to gain access to mentors as you go through the homework, or any other questions that arise.

If you're using a Chromebook, skip down to the Cloud9 instructions at the bottom.

### 2. Install/Update Node.js & npm {#install-nodejs}

In the second part of this session, we use a tool called Yeoman, which we install using npm [a package manager, which we'll cover in detail in the August session]. npm requires we install Node.js [which we'll cover in the September session]. All you need to know about them for this session is how to install or update these tools.

1.  Open your CLI

  {% hint style='info' %}

  The "terminal" and "command line" (aka CLI, command line interface) are the same thing.
  - On Windows, we use **Git Bash**
  - On Mac, we use **iTerm2**

  {% endhint %}

2.  In your CLI, type: ``node --version``

    Do you get a version number [_Version **6 or greater** required._]?

    1. No version number [something like `node: command not found`]. You need to install Node.

      <!--sec data-title="Mac - Install Node" data-id="sectionInstallMac" data-show=true data-collapse=true ces-->

      1. In iTerm2, type: ``brew update``

      2. When that finishes, type: ``brew install node``

      3. Confirm ``node --version`` returns a version **6 or greater**.

      <!--endsec-->

      <!--sec data-title="Windows - Install Node" data-id="sectionInstallWindows" data-show=true data-collapse=true ces-->

      1. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/) the **Current** installer for Windows [v.7.10.0].

      2. Double-click on the downloaded file & follow the installation prompts.

      3. When that finishes, confirm ``node --version`` returns a version **6 or greater**.

      <!--endsec-->

    2. If your version number is **6 or greater**, proceed to Step 3.

    3. If your version number is less than **6**, you'll need to update Node.

      <!--sec data-title="Mac - Update Node" data-id="sectionUpdateMac" data-show=true data-collapse=true ces-->

      1. In iTerm2, type the following: ``brew update``

      2. When that finishes, type: ``brew upgrade node``

      3. Confirm ``node --version`` returns a version **6 or greater**.

      <!--endsec-->

      <!--sec data-title="Windows - Update Node" data-id="sectionUpdateWindows" data-show=true data-collapse=true ces-->

      1. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/) the **Current** installer for Windows [v.7.10.0].

      2. Double-click on the downloaded file & follow the installation prompts.

      3. When that finishes, confirm ``node --version`` returns a version **6 or greater**.

      <!--endsec-->  

3. Let's check your version of npm [which was installed with Node]. [_Version **3 or greater** required._]  
   In your CLI, type: ``npm --version``  

   1. If your version is **3 or greater**, proceed to Step 3.

   2. If your version is less than **3**, update to the latest by typing: ``npm install npm -g``

### 3. Create _Architecture_ Folder

Create a folder named _Architecture_ in your _CodingAndCocktails_ folder.

### 4. Final Step

If you're using a Mac, you're ready for Part I! Windows users, you have one more set-up check.

<!--sec data-title="Windows" data-id="cliWindowsException" data-show=true data-collapse=true ces-->

Yeoman & Git Bash don't play nicely out of the box, so we'll need to run Bash in the Window's native cmd.exe [Command Prompt].

1. Find & open the **Command Prompt** program on your computer.

2. Type the following into the Command Prompt: ``"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" --login -i``

3. If your CLI looks like the following, you are ready for Part I [use this in Part II for CLI].

{% hint style='danger' %}
If your CLI doesn't look similar to the above screenshot, grab a mentor. You may need to adjust the path to bash [``C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`` this part of the command you typed]. And if that doesn't work, install the full version of [cmder](http://cmder.net/) [another Console emulator for Windows].
{% endhint %}

<!--sec data-title="Chromebooks Only: Cloud9 Instructions" data-id="section0" data-show=true data-collapse=true ces-->

1. Sign up for an account at [c9.io](https://c9.io)

   Note: It will ask you for credit card information, but you will not get charged for anything since we do not use features of Cloud9 that cost money. Ask a mentor for the Coding & Cocktails card for Cloud9.

2. Confirm your account from your email and log in to Cloud9.

3. Select **Workspaces** from the left side panel if you are not already there.

4. Choose **Create a new workspace**.

5. Add a name for your workspace - it can be anything you like. You do not need a description, but feel free to add one if you like.

6. Let's clone a repo from Github so the files we need for Part I will be in our workspace for us.

  1. Visit the [Front End Architecture repo in Github](https://github.com/KansasCityWomeninTechnology/front-end-architecture-ws).

  2. Click the green **Clone or download** button & then click the clipboard icon to copy the path.

  3. Go back to Cloud9 & paste this path into the **Clone from Git or Mercurial URL** field.

7. Leave your workspace as **Public**.

8. In the template section choose **Node.js**.

9. Click on the **Create Workspace** button.

   Cloud9 will take a minute and create your workspace here.

10. We need to update the version of Node.js that Cloud9 uses by default. We'll use node version manager to install version 7. In the terminal section of your workspace, type: `nvm install 7`

  {% hint style='tip' %}

  To make the terminal section bigger, hover over the top line of the terminal section with your mouse - it will change to an up-down arrow icon and then you can drag up which will also make the file editing area smaller.

  ![](assets/images/c9_terminal.png)

  {% endhint %}

11. If we leave Cloud9 and come back to this workspace, the version of Node.js resets, so let's change the default. In the terminal, type: `nvm alias default 7`

12. In the terminal, type: `npm install -g npm`

13. In the terminal, type: `npm install -g gulp`

14. In the terminal, type `mkdir CodingAndCocktails` to create your folder/directory that you'll be working in tonight. You'll notice a new folder show up on the left side of your screen.

15. Create a folder within _CodingAndCocktails_ named _Architecture_.

  {% hint style='danger' %}

  Any time the worksheet mentions to change directory to your home directory or type `cd ~` you will want to type `cd ~/workspace` instead.

  {% endhint %}

16. All the files that were cloned from the Github repo are in your workspace. That means you're ready to start with Part I, Step 2 & skip downloading the files in Step 1.
