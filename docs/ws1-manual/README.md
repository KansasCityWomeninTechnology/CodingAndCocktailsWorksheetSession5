This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}

## Create application folder and download assets {#assets} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Let's get the files we need so we can practice website asset organization.
{% include "./1download.md" %}

## Group like files into appropriate directories {#organize} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Now we need to group like files so that the website assets are well organized.
{% include "./2organize.md" %}

## Update references in the HTML file {#references} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Lastly, we need to update references to the assets in _index.html_ so that our website displays properly.
{% include "./3references.md" %}

- You already have the files you need so you can skip the first step to download files. 

- To preview your file in Codeanywhere, right click on the _index.html_ in the file explorer and select **Preview**.

- Instead of Atom, you'll be using the built-in text editor in your workspace. Double-click on the _index.html_ file to open it in the editor.
